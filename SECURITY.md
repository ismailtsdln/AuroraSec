- Any suggested fixes.

### Response Process

Upon receiving a report, we will:
1. Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours.
2. Investigate the issue and determine the severity.
3. Work on a fix.
4. Notify you once the fix has been implemented and released.
5. Provide credit for the discovery (unless you prefer to remain anonymous).
